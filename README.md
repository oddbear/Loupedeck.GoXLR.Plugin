# Loupedeck.GoXLR.Plugin
GoXLR Plugin (unofficial) for the Loupedeck (live) interface.

For instructions and download see: [v0.0.2-pre](https://github.com/oddbear/Loupedeck.GoXLR.Plugin/releases/tag/v0.0.2-pre)

To connect, click the `Connect to Stream Deck` button in the GoXLR App. <br />
Only **one plugin** can run **at the same time**, so if you are already using another GoXLR plugin, this needs to be closed/uninstalled first.

The code is tested against the GoXLR App v1.4.9.172 (beta), and Loupedeck v5.0.1.<br />
And will not work on older versions.

This project is unofficial, and none of the developers are associated with TC-Helicon Gaming or Loupedeck.<br />
The code is MIT licensed, that is, free, no warranty, and you can do whatever you want with it.

This plugin is based on the [Touch Portal plugin](https://github.com/oddbear/GoXLR-TouchPortal-Plugin), that is a port of the StreamDeck plugin by using the same API from the GoXLR App.<br />
The plugin is therefore limited to the same features that the StreamDeck plugin supports.

Made using the [Loupedeck Plugin SDK 4](https://github.com/Loupedeck/LoupedeckPluginSdk4/wiki)
